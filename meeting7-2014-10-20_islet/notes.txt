Talks - ISLET:

Isolated, Scalable, and Lightweight Environment for Training: https://github.com/jonschipp/ISLET

	Talk Details:

ISLET is a container system for teaching Linux based software with minimal participation effort.
It reduces the barrier of participation by only requiring an SSH client. We have been using ISLET
to teach NSM tools at OpenNSM. This talk is designed to teach presenters how to create their own
ISLET configurations for training.

	Presenter:

Jon Schipp is a Security Engineer at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications.
He's also a contributor to Netsniff-NG, SecurityOnion, the Bro project, and the author of ISLET.
