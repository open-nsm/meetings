Are there any open source/open data repositories that can be used by students for a lab environment? , any suggestions on open source projects to join for newbies for internet security/ data science projects to join?
18:55:29	 From Travis Schack : Can you search for a known hash across your fleet?
18:57:54	 From js-cam : Hitesh, are you looking to get experience in collaborating on Open Source projects?

19:01:25	 From Travis Schack : Any integration with Yara or OpenIOCs?
19:01:46	 From js-cam : Hitesh, most if not all projects encourage and need help. Github make it easy to contribute code. You just have to find something you’re interested in or need.
