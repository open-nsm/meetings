  Big Talks:
    OSquery:
    Website: http://osquery.io/, http://prosauce.org/
    Talk Details: Demonstration of installing osquery, running the shell, deploying
      the daemon, and spending some time on what information osquery surfaces, how
      that's useful in SQL-style joins, what types of queries have been
      helpful in finding threats, and what's important information we're
      missing and how to improve the tool by creating additions!
    Presenter: Teddy Reed, developer of OSQuery, is very passionate about
      trustworthy, safe, and secure code development. He loves open source
      and collaborative development when scale, resiliency, and performance
      enable defensive and protective software design. Live and breath security
      engineering and dream in code.

      Prior to production and enterprise security engineering, he held
      several research and development positions with focuses on large scale
      system assessments, application penetration testing, and system and
      hardware emulation. He has published and presented at security
      conferences on trusted computing, hardware trusted systems, UAVs,
      botnet development, human performance engineering, competition game
      theory, biometric vulnerabilities, and PaaS API vulnerabilities. he
      enjoys a good CTF and I have fun developing new and interesting (and
      long!) CTF challenges.
