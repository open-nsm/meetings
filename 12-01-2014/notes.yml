    Presenter: Brad is a security analyst located in the San Antonio, Texas area.
      He specializes in network traffic analysis and intrusion detection.
      After 21 years doing classified intelligence work for the US military,
      Brad began a new career as a traffic analyst in the summer of 2010.
      He started the malware-traffic-analysis.net blog in the summer of 2013
      as a way to share information--Brad wanted to provide the type of resource
      he would've liked when he started out. Since then, the blog has slowly
      grown in popularity among like-minded security professionals.
