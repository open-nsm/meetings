  Big Talks:
    Stenographer:
    Website: https://github.com/google/stenographer, <gconnell@google.com>
    Talk Details: Stenographer is a daemon which writes packets to disk very quickly,
      then returns specific written packets to analysts on request.  Graeme will describe
      how this system works, how to deploy it, how it performs, and why it might be useful.
    Presenter: Graeme Connell is a software engineer. After a liberal arts college gave him
      a very rare BA in CS, he's spent the past eight years at Google. There, he has focussed
      on building security monitoring tools and services, including SIEM and IDS systems.
      His primary interest is network-based detection and packet wrangling. He's the owner
      of http://github.com/google/stenographer, a packet-to-disk spooler, as well as
      http://code.google.com/p/gopacket, a library to process packet data in Go.
