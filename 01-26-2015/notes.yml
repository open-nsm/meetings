    Applied Detection and Analysis Using Flow Data:
    Website: 'http://www.appliednsm.com, http://www.chrissanders.org'
    Contact: @chrissanders88, @automayt
    Talk Details: While network flow data isn’t a new concept, it is easily one of the most powerful data types you
      can have in your arsenal as a network defender. It is incredibly low overhead, easy to setup and maintain, and
      provides tremendously flexible capabilities for network security monitoring (NSM) detection and analysis.
      In this presentation, we will take a look at flow data from the perspective of the NSM analyst. To begin,
      we will harness the power of statistics to demonstrate how flow data can be used for detecting both structured
      and unstructured threats using techniques that go beyond simple signature matching. Next, we will discuss the
      concept of friendly intelligence and how flow data can be used to profile devices on your network so you can
      understand what normal communication looks like. Finally, we will describe how flow data can be used to augment
      the analysis of network security events that are detected by other mechanisms. During this presentation, we will
      also introduce and demonstrate FlowPlotter, an open source tool we have developed to aide in visualizing flow data
      for detection and analysis, and FlowBAT, a web-based tool for performing flow data analysis. Every concept we discuss
      in this presentation will be demonstrated with practical, real-world scenarios complete with real data using the SiLK
      toolset. Our hope is that you will leave this talk with techniques you can apply to your network immediately with
      incredibly low overhead and high impact.
    Presenter: Chris Sanders is an information security consultant, author, and researcher
      Chris leads a team within Mandiant focused on detection and threat intelligence. He has extensive experience
      supporting multiple government and military agencies, as well as several Fortune 500 companies.
      In multiple roles with the US Department of Defense, Chris significantly helped to further the
      role of the Computer Network Defense Service Provider (CNDSP) model, and helped to create several
      NSM and intelligence tools currently being used to defend the interests of the nation.
      Chris has authored several books and articles, including the international best seller
      "Practical Packet Analysis" form No Starch Press and his most recent book "Applied Network Security Monitoring"

      Jason Smith is an intrusion detection analyst by day and junkyard engineer by night. Jason started his career
      mining large data sets and performing finite element analysis as a budding physicist. Jason has a long history
      of assisting state and federal agencies with hardening their defensive perimeters and currently works as a
      Security Engineer with Mandiant. As part of his development work, he has created several open source projects,
      many of which have become "best-practice" tools for the DISA CNDSP program.
