    OSX Collector:
    Website: https://github.com/Yelp/osxcollector
    Talk Details: We use Macs a lot at Yelp, which means that we see our fair
    share of Mac-specific security alerts. Host based detectors will tell us
    about known malware infestations or weird new startup items. Network based
    detectors see potential C2 callouts or DNS requests to resolve suspicious
    domains. Sometimes our awesome employees just let us know, "I think I have
    like Stuxnet or conficker or something on my laptop.”

    When alerts fire, our incident response team’s first goal is to "stop the
    bleeding" – to contain and then eradicate the threat. Next, we move to “root
    cause the alert" – figuring out exactly what happened and how we'll prevent
    it in the future. One of our primary tools for root causing OS X alerts is
    OSXCollector.

    OSXCollector is an open source forensic evidence collection and analysis
    toolkit for OS X. It was developed in-house at Yelp to automate the digital
    forensics and incident response (DFIR) our crack team of responders had been
    doing manually.

    Presenter: Ivan Leichtling @c0wl, leads an amazing team of engineers focused on
    securing Yelp's visitors, mobile apps, websites, employees, and
    infrastructure. Ivan holds a BS in Computer Science from the Columbia
    University School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. Prior to Yelp, Ivan
    spent a dozen years writing software, building hardware, and leading teams
    at Microsoft. Ivan is an anagram of vain and as such appreciates Twitter
    followers at @c0wl and @YelpEngineering.
