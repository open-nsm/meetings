    Malware Reverse Engineering:
    Website: http://z0inks.com/
    Talk Details: Brandon will be explaining the basics of reverse engineering malware.
    Presenter: Brandon is a security researcher at Lancope where he works on finding
      neat ways to use flow data for incident response and detection. He wanted to
      make a joke about studying other people's malware to better write his own, but
      he wasn't sure that it'd be clear that it was (kind of) a joke.
