    Malware Reverse Engineering:
    Website: http://z0inks.com/, https://twitter.com/BrandonTansey
    Talk Details: Brandon will be explaining the basics of reverse engineering malware.
    Presenter: Brandon is a security researcher at Lancope where he works on finding
      neat ways to use flow data for incident response and detection. He has given talks
      on x86 assembly and reverse engineering at conferences like PhreakNIC. He wanted to
      make a joke about studying other people's malware to better write his own, but
      he wasn't sure that it'd be clear that it was (kind of) a joke.
