    Network Scout:
    Website: https://github.com/NetworkScout/ns
    Talk Details: Network Scout is an intrusion detection system and honeypot.
      It was built on TrustedSec's Artillery. It allows for a distributed system
      of scouts. The system is similar to the tsunami warning system on the coast.
      The scout is like a buoy in the ocean, and the scout server is the central
      warning system. If the scout detects an abnormality, it sends a warning to
      the server. We will be discussing how we built it, how we coded it, and more.
    Presenter: Shawn Jordan, @ph_shawn, is currently a Digital Forensics and Information
      Assurance major at Marshall University. He will be graduating this May. He
      is co-creator of Network Scout - a distributed honeypot/IDS. He has spoken
      at DerbyCon 4.0, Hack3rCon 5, and AIDE 2015. He has also presented at
      Research Day at the Capitol in West Virginia. He is currently a volunteer at
      a local middle school where he teaches teenagers how to code in Python.
