    Patching Malware:
    Website: http://www.malwarebytes.org/, https://twitter.com/kujman5000
    Talk Details: While performing in-depth malware code analysis, often times it helps to step
      through the code as you document its purpose and flow.  Sometimes you get lucky and just follow
      along as the malware runs its natural course and other times the settings of your environment or
      anti-analysis functionality might lead you to an early termination.  Therefore, one of the less
      mentioned aspects of malware code analysis is the ability to change the code or "patch" in real
      time, allowing for the analyst to force the malware into revealing its secrets. This talk will
      cover a quick overview of the importance of patching, how it is done and a look at the dangers
      associated. Finally there will be a few real world examples of malware patching.
    Presenter: Adam Kujawa is the Head of Malware Intelligence @ Malwarebytes, with 10 years of
      experience fighting malware behind the scenes and on the front lines. He has spent time
      analyzing threats of an APT / State Sponsored nature as well as threats to consumers for both
      government and private industry.  In addition to research and analysis, he has provided
      conference talks and developed technical courses on topics from basic to advanced malware
      analysis, malware evolution and threat intelligence. He has had articles published in SC
      Magazine, TechCrunch and other notable tech publications as well as being frequently quoted on
      matters of computer security by news organizations.
